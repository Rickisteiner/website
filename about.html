    <p>Once upon a time there was a young, small town girl named Ricki. She always felt like an outsider but never truly understood why. She felt restless and a constant pull towards new adventures... often in numbers of two. Ricki studied Graphic Design in college for two years after a two year journey to Israel. College was an amazing experience but never really seemed like the proper way for the young creative to learn. She felt the wind calling her to pursue a new opportunity and she could no longer ignore it.</p>

    <p>The wind led her to a new idea, NYC. Night after night she spent glued to her computer screen and applied to 100 internships. Finally, she succeeded in finding a new challenge to embark on. Ricki packed up all her art supplies and took the long journey from Cleveland to the shining land of NYC.</p>

    <p>In NYC, Ricki interned with a company called Black Ocean for two months before being hired on full-time. As an intern, she wrote articles for 4 different lifestyle blogs. As a full-time employee, Ricki founded <a href="http://www.honestyforbreakfast.com" target="_blank"> Honesty For Breakfast </a> and helped design about 20 different active websites. But as 2 years began to move closer, Ricki began to feel restless again. The website was a part of her, but there was no more growth available. Where had the challenge gone? Ricki had also given up a dream somewhere a long the way. You see, she never planned to run a blog or become a writer. Ricki had always dreamed of becoming a web developer. She began to wonder if perhaps it was time to listen to the wind once more.</p>

    <p>The wind led her someplace she had kept an eye on for a few years, Web Development Immersive at General Assembly. After her short lived college career, Ricki fell in love with the idea of alternative methods of education. So here she is, studying away in the packed halls of GA and trying her best to figure out how the heck one is supposed to network.</p>

    <p>Long term, Ricki hopes to stay in the start-up world and eventually make turn her own ideas into a thriving business. But for now, she is glued to her computer screen - coding and designing away. This time she is certain that this adventure will last for more than two years. The wind has been pretty silent recently and she is thrilled to have found her happy ending... a place where she finally feels like she belongs.</p>
